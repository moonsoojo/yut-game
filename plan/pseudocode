moving piece logic
- when Vani wants to move a ufo to eat a rocket, she clicks the rocket, not the star.
  - make the whole tile clickable
  - if you click piece and it's not home, disable selection
  - if you click home and select piece, disable selection
- move a piece to a star by mistake
  - right click to clear star

# - make dots clearer on normal yuts
# - more chance to flip on the rounded side
- animate UFO
- yuts jump on re-render

- possible bug: invisible mesh covers a visible one
- operation notes: clicking a star without a selection clears it

- click piece
  - state: selectedPiece
- click tile
- piece disappears from where it was
  - state: pop piece in array
- piece appears above tile
  - if it's on a planet, it circles it
  - if it's multiple pieces, it circles in a line
- move pieces around as objects
- when you click one on a tile, copy everything on the tile
- assign indices to each tile. get pieces on tile via the state and the index
- pass number of pieces as an argument to the piece
- refactor piecesTeam# logic
  - use index in array as team id

animations
- pieces circle planets
- ufo idle animation
- rocket idle animation
  - bug: moving piece when it's animated causes error
# - finishing pieces
# - placing pieces on planets
# - sun
