moving piece logic
- when Vani wants to move a ufo to eat a rocket, she clicks the rocket, not the star.
  - make the whole tile clickable
  - if you click piece and it's not home, disable selection
  - if you click home and select piece, disable selection
- move a piece to a star by mistake
  - right click to clear star

# - make dots clearer on normal yuts
# - more chance to flip on the rounded side
- animate UFO
- yuts jump on re-render

- possible bug: invisible mesh covers a visible one

animations
- pieces circle planets
- ufo idle animation
- rocket idle animation
  - bug: moving piece when it's animated causes error
- add patterns to saturn and neptune so you can tell it's turning
# - finishing pieces
# - placing pieces on planets
# - sun
